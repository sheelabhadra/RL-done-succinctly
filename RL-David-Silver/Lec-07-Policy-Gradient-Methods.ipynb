    "### Policy-based RL\n",
    "* The policy is directly parametrized\n",
    "$$\\pi_{\\theta}(s,a) = \\mathbb P[a|s,\\theta]$$\n",
    "* We control the parameters of distribution from which we are picking actions. It can be thought of a function approximator where we plug in our state and the model tells us which action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy-based vs value-based\n",
    "* Situations where it might be tricky to find the action from the value and policy might be simpler\n",
    "    * eg. in an Atari game, moving to the left when a ball is coming downwards is easier to approximate than figuring out that moving to the left would result in a score of say 1124.\n",
    "    * Policies can be more compact in these cases\n",
    "* It has better convergence property - following gradients to learn the policy leads to smoother updates in the policy\n",
    "* Effective in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces\n",
    "* It can learn stochastic policies\n",
    "* Value-based RL learns a near-deterministic policy (eg. greedy or $\\epsilon$-greedy) while policy-based RL can learn the optimal stochastic policy (especially true in POMDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "* Naive policy based RL can be slower and have high variance\n",
    "* It typically converges to a local instead of a global optimum"
