    "- There's no supervisor, only a *reward* signal\n",
    "    - There's no immediate feedback on whether the decision was good or bad\n",
    "- Feedback is delayed, not instantaneous\n",
    "    - The feedback is obtained many steps later to know whether the set of decisions were good or bad\n",
    "- Time really matters (sequential, non i.i.d data)\n",
    "    - An agent moves through a dynamic system where things observed at a time instant are correlated with the things observed in the immediate next time instant\n",
    "- Agent's actions affect the subsequent data it receives"
